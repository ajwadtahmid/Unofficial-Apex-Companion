## Ranked Breakdown Guide

> **TL;DR:** Keep Apexlytics open while you play ranked, turn on **Keep
> screen on** in Settings so it doesn't stop tracking when your screen locks.
> A browser tab on apexlegendsstatus.com works too, if you'd rather not keep
> the app open. Past matches can't be recovered.

### Getting started

1. Open Apexlytics and start playing ranked.
2. Turn on **Keep screen on** in Settings so tracking doesn't stop the moment
   your screen locks.
3. Finish a match: it'll appear in your Ranked Breakdown once it ends.

Prefer not to keep the app open? Keeping a browser tab open on your
[profile page](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/profile/search/) on
apexlegendsstatus.com works too, just make sure it's your actual profile
page, not the homepage.

### "Server busy"?

We're limited by our API's request budget. Nothing is lost, you'll see your
data soon.

### Heads up

Tracking is forward-only: only matches played after you start tracking are
recorded, so earlier matches can't be pulled in retroactively.

---

## Development

### Requirements

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Flutter SDK | 3.x (stable channel) |
| Dart SDK | bundled with Flutter |
| Android: Java | 17 |
| iOS/macOS: Xcode | 15+ |
| Linux: GTK | `libgtk-3-dev` |

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/ajwadtahmid/Apexlytics.git
cd Apexlytics

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Update .env with your credentials
# Edit .env and set PROXY_URL and CLIENT_TOKEN (see Configuration below)

# 5. Generate env code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 6. Run
flutter run
```

### Configuration

The app proxies all API calls through a private server instead of calling APIs directly (keeps credentials and tokens secure on the backend). You'll need to set up a proxy server that implements the endpoints below.

```env
# .env
PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy-server.example.com
CLIENT_TOKEN=your-secret-token
SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/01234567
```

After editing `.env`, regenerate:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### Required Endpoints

Your proxy server must implement these endpoints:

- **`GET /maprotation`**: Returns current and next map rotations for Ranked, Pubs, Mixtape, and Wildcards
- **`GET /player/:platform/:playerName`**: Returns player stats (rank, RP, legend data, trackers)
- **`GET /predator`**: Returns current Apex Predator RP cutoff per platform
- **`GET /servers`**: Returns server status (login, EA accounts, crossplay health)
- **`GET /news`**: Returns official Apex Legends news feed
- **`GET /games`**: Returns ranked match history for a UID (used by Ranked Breakdown). Budgeted upstream; returns `202` with a `status`/`retryAfterSeconds` body when the request is queued or the player isn't being tracked yet, instead of `200` with match data
- **`GET /games/eligibility`**: Returns whether match history is currently accruing for a UID, without spending a `/games` request

All requests must include the `x-client-token` header with your `CLIENT_TOKEN` value.


## Data & Privacy

- **No login, no account.** All data is public (player stats are visible on apexlegendsstatus.com).
- **No analytics or tracking.** The app does not collect or send any user data.
- **Local-only storage.** Cached responses and snapshots are stored on-device only.

Data is sourced from [apexlegendsstatus.com](https://apexlegendsstatus.com) and [apexlegendsapi.com](https://apexlegendsapi.com).

## Credits & Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:

- **[Hugo Derave](https://github.com/HugoDerave)**: Developer and maintainer of the [Unofficial Apex Legends API](https://apexlegendsapi.com/), which powers player stats lookups, map rotation data, and server status for this app
- **[Apex Legends Status](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/)**: Provides real-time server status, map rotation data, and players stats with comprehensive ranked stats, leaderboard for ranked along with all trackers and so much more

This project would not be possible without these amazing resources and the developer behind them.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this app affiliated with Respawn/EA?**
No, this is an unofficial fan project. This app is not affiliated with Respawn or EA in any way. This just uses the API provided by apexlegendsapi.com to display player stats, map information, and other game data.

**Q: How often is player data updated?**
Player stats are fetched fresh from the API when you search. Cached data is available offline but may be stale.

**Q: Will my account be compromised?**
The app doesn't store your account credentials. You only provide a player name or UID, which are public information visible on apexlegendsstatus.com.

**Q: Can I track multiple players at once?**
Yes, add players to favorites for quick access. You can also compare stats with any player.

**Q: How reliable is the API?**
The app depends on [apexlegendsapi.com](https://apexlegendsapi.com/) and [apexlegendsstatus.com](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/). These services are community-run and may experience occasional downtime. The app gracefully falls back to cached data when APIs are unavailable.

**Q: What platforms are supported?**
Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**
No. Just search for any public player by name or UID.

## Known Limitations

- **RP snapshots**: Only tracks if app is open and sync is completed. RP gains when app is closed are not captured.
- **Ranked Breakdown tracking**: Only records matches while Apexlytics (or your profile page on apexlegendsstatus.com) is open, and only from the point tracking starts; earlier matches can't be recovered. A shared API budget across all users can briefly delay a new profile's tracking with a "Server busy" state. See the [Ranked Breakdown Guide](#ranked-breakdown-guide).
- **Legend stats**: Tracker names and values are as reported by the Apex Legends Status API; custom or seasonal tracker names may not be fully supported.
- **Predator cutoff**: Updates each hour. Doesn't refresh automatically; manual refresh required to see latest cutoff.
- **Offline player search**: If a player hasn't been searched before, their data won't be cached and you'll need internet to look them up.
- **Desktop crash reporting**: Crash reports are only sent on Android and iOS. Desktop builds (Linux, Windows, macOS) don't report crashes automatically, since Sentry's crash handler can't reliably run there; desktop issues rely on user-submitted [bug reports](https://github.com/ajwadtahmid/Apexlytics/issues).
